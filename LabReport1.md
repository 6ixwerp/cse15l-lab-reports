For my first use of ls which contained no arguments, the working directory would be ~ or /home. The reason I had gotten this output is because ls calls for a list of the current directory contents. Since there are no arguments, this means all shell arguments are printed so it will print out just the lecture1 directory instead of providing a current directory. This output is expected.
