# Lab Report 2

PART 2:
The bug I had chosen from the list given to me was under the Array examples where I needed to successfully reverse an array with all the elements in that order. 
My first step was to create a failure inducing input for the buggy program, as a JUnit test. 
# code block
import static org.junit.Assert.assertArrayEquals;
import org.junit.Test;

public class reverseFail {

    @Test
    public void testReverseFail() {
        int[] input = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        int[] expected = {5, 4, 3, 2, 1};
        int[] reversedArray = ReversedArray.reversed(input);
        assertArrayEquals(expected, reversedArray);
    }
}
