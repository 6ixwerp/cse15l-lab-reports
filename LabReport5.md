**PART 1**

Hello, I typed up my bash.sh recently but I am now receiving an error and I can't seem to figure out why. This had worked previously but now I can't 
seem to get the same result from when it ran in lab yesterday. I am considering the possibility that it is an issue with my JUnit test because it 
produces a large error output in the terminal, but I wouldn't know why because I had pathed to them when I was in the lab.

TA: Hello, it would appear that the JUnit tests were never initialized...
I couldn't finish this I have the flu and am trying to recover

**PART 2**

I learned many things in this lab over the course of the quarter but I would say that the main thing that stood out to me was learning about vim. 
Although I was having trouble with it initially, as I watched the tutorial though I got a better grasp of how to navigate through it and it made 
editing documents and other things so much easier to do. Another cool thing I learned was the functions used in linux such as grep, which make it 
easier to do pretty much anything within your files.
